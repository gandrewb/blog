	<h1>Happy Place: A Pixar Cityscape</h1>
	<p>I can't imagine it's a secret to you that I've got a serious affinity for all things Pixar. It's terminal. So, an invitation for poster submissions came from our building manager at work. I promise you I considered so many other ideas, but I really couldn't help it. The idea of a Pixar cityscape just seemed too irresistible.</p>
	<p>I originally made the misguided choice to list every notable building or location I could from each movie and included them all in an early draft. Needless to say, there was little appeal in that approach. I'm just ashamed that it took me so long to put my finger on the problem. But it's amazing what a deadline will do for the clarity of your vision. Because at the last minute, it fell into place. I subtracted all but one building from each film, put them all on the same baseline and suddenly it became what I meant it to be from the start.</p>
